go mod init go_books_store_api

go run .\cmd\api\
```

## Few Options to develop Web API in go lang

> 1. Discussion and Demo

### 1. **net/http (Default Go HTTP package)**

> 1. `Documentation:` <https://pkg.go.dev/net/http>
> 1. `Overview`: The standard library's `net/http` package is a lightweight, built-in solution that provides everything needed to serve HTTP requests without external dependencies.
> 1. `When to use`: Ideal for small, simple projects or when you want full control over the HTTP server without relying on third-party libraries.

### 2. **Gorilla Mux**

> 1. `Documentation:` <https://github.com/gorilla/mux>
> 1. `Overview`: `Gorilla Mux` is a powerful URL router and dispatcher that is more flexible than `net/http`. It allows for complex routing, including variables in URLs, regular expressions, and subrouters.
> 1. `When to use`: Suitable for more complex routing needs while maintaining a balance between simplicity and flexibility. Itâ€™s a widely used and trusted library.

### 3. **Gin**

> 1. `Documentation:` <https://gin-gonic.com/docs/>
> 1. `Overview`: Gin is a lightweight and fast web framework that includes a router, middleware, and useful utilities for building APIs. It is known for its performance due to its low memory footprint.
> 1. `When to use`: Use Gin if you need high performance, want minimalistic code, and require middleware support like logging, error handling, and more. It's popular for RESTful APIs.

## What we will be using?

> 1. Discussion and Demo
> 1. [net/http (Default Go HTTP package)](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http)

## [Hello World Endpoints](./src/cmd/v1/)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, you've requested: %s\n", r.URL.Path)
	})

	http.HandleFunc("/helloworld", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello Welcome to Go Lang World, you've requested: %s\n", r.URL.Path)
	})

	fmt.Println("Starting server on :8080")
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

## [Health Check Endpoints](./src/cmd/v2/)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/v1/healthcheck", healthcheck)
	http.HandleFunc("/v1/version", version)

	fmt.Println("Starting ... Server on port 8080")
	err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil) // Use default ServeMux
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error starting server: ", err)
	}
}

func healthcheck(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintln(w, "Status: Healthy")
}

func version(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Environment: %s\n", "Development")
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Version: %s\n", "1.0.1")
}
```

## [Locally scoped ServeMux](./src/cmd/v2/)
